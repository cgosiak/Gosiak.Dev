Hello, my name is Caleb. I am a software engineer! In fact looking back I have been a software engineer for what feels like a very long time to me (upwards of 7yrs). It feels kind of strange to talk about myself, but I suppose that's one of the reasons you are viewing a page titled "Introduction" in the "About Me" section of my website. So I better deliver on your expectations to the best of my ability.

I have worn many hats in my career; however, I have a couple general driving passions that I believe better sum up my experience.

- ### I like to help people

  I am passionate about projects that make peoples lives a little bit easier.

- ### I like to help developers

  Yes, I know developers are *technically* people too, but I am especially passionate about providing tools and advice to help other developers.

- ### I like to learn

  I like "staying in the know" on all the new tips, tools, and tricks of my trade. **Sometimes** they are helpful.

- ### I like to be challenged

  I don't like tedium. I am happiest when I am working hard on finding a solution to a wild problem.

I really hope that you found what you were looking for by visiting here!
